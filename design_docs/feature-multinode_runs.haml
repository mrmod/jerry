      it 'should treat the classyfing data a regex when the search_type is regex'
      it 'should treat the classifying data as a fact=value combo when the search_type is fact'
      it 'should treat the classifying data as a a space delimited set of ordered options when options is selected'
    %dir
      it 'should handle a form that is an array of existing class and parameter assignments'

      it 'should know what classes are available and the parameters for them'


  %h2 View behavior
  %pre
    %div
      it 'should have radio buttons for node, regex, and fact' 
      it 'should show "node options" when the node radio is selected' 
      it 'should show "node regex" when the regex radio is selected' 
      it 'should show "fact=value" when the regex radio is selected'

    %div
      it 'should provide a class search field above the assigned classes' 
      it 'should display the classes on the right from the search result' 
      it 'should not display assigned classes in the search result' 
    %div
      it 'should allow any class, assigned or a search result, to be modified'
